# Movie Search App

This is a simple web application that allows users to search for movies using the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/).

## Features

- Search for movies by title.
- Display movie details including title, year, director, actors, writer, and plot.
- Click on a movie to view more details in a modal.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you need to replace the `{apikey}` placeholder in `script.js` with your own OMDb API key.

### Prerequisites

- A valid [OMDb API key](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/moviesearchapp.git

2. Replace the {apikey} placeholder in script.js with your actual OMDb API key:

   ```bash
   const apiKey = '{apikey}'; // Replace {apikey} with your OMDb API key

### Running the Application

To run the application locally, you can use the Live Server extension for Visual Studio Code:

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Install the Live Server extension if you haven't already.
3. Right-click on index.html in the file explorer and select "Open with Live Server".

This will start a local development server and open your application in the default web browser. Any changes you make to your files will be automatically reflected in the browser.
